terraform required providers

from 0.13 onwards it is a best practice to use required providers

benfits include
defining multiple provider confugurations
creates dependency lock file automatically 
version can be controlled with version attribute

NOTE ON VERSIONS :
FROM 0.13 
incase of same provider but differnt regions we can use alias parametera 

NOTE :
PROVIDER WITHOUT ALIAS IS THE DEFALT ONE 
make sure you have multiple alias with respect to differnt specs
